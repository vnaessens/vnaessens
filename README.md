- 👋 Hi, I’m @vnaessens. I used to be a developer, but my current job has not given me the chance to do programming stuff anymore. So, I work on little projects during my free time when I am not reading, running, traveling.
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things and in no particular order : A.I., data science, astrophotography, 3D rendering, cyber-security, error correcting codes, cryptography, Game Theory.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, WPF, OpenCV and maybe Rust someday.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on any project for the moment (due to lack of time).
- 📫 How to reach me ...
